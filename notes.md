# Notes
> TCP/IPV6 uses the System32/drivers/tcpip.sys driver, so that may be a good place to start looking for the buffer underflow vulnerability. [https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/ipv6-connectivity/df8f26cc-fe15-408f-b0e1-58bf4020d9be] <br>
> tcpip.sys driver was taken from a windows 10 install at version 10.0.19045.
